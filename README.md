# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

The goal was to try out react native for the first time. We had a very open brief and I created a basic meditation app with a timer and navigation between screens. 

## The problem

I found it hard to grasp what it takes to do certain features, what seems simple can be super tricky and was seems complicated could be a bit easier than expected. This made me spend a lot of time on google and just coming up with an idea that I could finish with the few days we had. I would have loved to add a lottie animation and push notifications for the app too. I will try to add the animaiton at least when I have the time.
